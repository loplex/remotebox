remotebox (2.6-0~loplex1) cosmic; urgency=medium

  * Packaging maintained by loplex [https://github.com/loplex/remotebox]
  * New upstream version(s)
    2.6 (06 Jan 2019)
    -----------------
    - RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 6.0.x
    - Added additional screen modes for video capture and video hinting
    - Added option to select between Video and Audio, Video Only or Audio Only when
      screen capturing
    - Added support for VirtualBox VGA card with VMware SVGA II extensions
    - Added support for having no graphics card in the guest. Note however, you
      cannot connect to the guest with RDP/VNC without a virtual graphics card.
    - Added support for setting the emulated serial UART type
    - The Audio Input and Audio Output options can now also be set while the guest
      is running
    - Added support to the VMM (Virtual Media Manager) for compaction of hard disk
      images to reduce their physical size
    - Added support to the VMM (Virtual Media Manager) for resizing hard disk
      images
    - Added ability to save a guest log to a local text file
    - Added refresh button to reload the guest logs in the log viewer
    - Added cancel button to the VirtualBox Preferences dialog
    - Removed Host-Only-Network and NAT Network configuration from the VirtualBox
      preferences dialog and created the Host Network Manager dialog accessible from
      the file menu
    - Signnificantly updated the RemoteBox icon set and added additional decals
    - To work around a VirtualBox bug, when changing a shared folder the guest
      settings are now explicitly saved. This includes adding, editing and deleting
    - Optimised a lot of the settings retrieval code which should improve latency
      especially for those on slower systems and networks.
    - Fixed the Edit Shared Folder dialog not correctly showing a share's Permanent
      Status, when editing the shared folder.
    - Various code cleanups
    2.5 (29 Apr 2018)
    -----------------
    - RemoteBox now only pops up a VirtualBox Extensions warning dialog on login,
      for server operating systems that have them available but the extension pack
      is not installed. Currently this is Linux, Solaris, Windows and MacOS X.
      Others such as FreeBSD will just get a warning in the message log as there
      are no VirtualBox extensions.
    - Added support for setting the Audio driver of a guest when using a FreeBSD
      server
    - Improved the code which automatically adds the guest addition ISO to the VMM
      on login which should prevent an error if the server does not provide a guest
      additions ISO
    - Added support for VNC. If your server has the VNC extension pack installed,
      you can use VNC to connect to the guest displays instead of RDP. You must
      install a VNC client on your RemoteBox machine and configure it as
      appropriate in your preferences. TigerVNC is the default client
    - The guest display icon now shows whether the server expects a VNC or RDP
      connection when opening the display of guests.
    - Added option to change the floppy drive type to 360k, 720k, 1.44MB, 2.88MB
      15.6MB and 63.5MB.
    - Added a button to assist with the automatic generation of serial port paths
    - Fixed a bug causing the port path setting to be reset with the defaults
    - Fixed audio support for Solaris servers. The SolAudio driver is non
      functional in VirtualBox and has been replaced with OSS.
    2.4 (4 Nov 2017)
    ----------------
    - RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 5.2.x
    - Updated guest icons
    - Added option to enable/disable audio output from a guest
    - Added option to enable/disable audio input to a guest
    - Added option to record audio from the guest when capturing a video
    - Added support for exporting appliances to Oracle Public Cloud Format 1.0
    - Added ability to select a connection profile to use for automatically logging
      in when starting up RemoteBox.
    - Added option 'Release Keys' to clear any held keys in the case where a host
      and guest's keyboard status may become out of sync.
    - New guests now automatically have their audio output enabled
    - Fixed: You now can't set video RAM to zero, even though VirtualBox reports
      this as a valid minimum, the guest won't start.

remotebox (2.3-1~getdeb1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - Implemented a connection profile manager and changed the connection
    dialog.
      Passwords can optionally be saved, however if you're highly concerned
      about
      security, the password can still be manually entered at connection
      time.
    - Improved remote file choosers by remembering their last location
    throughout a
      RemoteBox session.
    - Added preference option to sort the guest list alphabetically or leave
    it in
      natural order.
    - Default RDP option now uses the FreeRDP new syntax unless previously
      configured
    - Added OS icon for Windows 2016
    - Fixed regression when setting setting the auto start delay time for a
    guest,
      it would get reset to 0
    - When renaming the current snapshot, the new name would not be shown in
    the
      guest list until refreshed. This has now been fixed.
    - Various minor GUI tweaks

remotebox (2.2-1~getdeb1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 5.1.x
    - Added support for adding an NVMe Controller to the guest
    - Added the ability to set the number of SAS ports
    - Added support for setting the hot-pluggable flag on harddisk and
    optical devices attached to SATA or USB storage controllers

 -- Jhonny Oliveira <jhonny.oliveira@gmail.com>  Sat, 21 Jun 2014 20:14:50 +0200

remotebox (1.8-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - Added option to automatically start chosen guests when the host system
    boots.
      This requires some server side configuration before it can be used.
      Consult
      the RemoteBox manual for more information.
    - Added option to set the start delay on an autostarting guest so that
    guests can be started up in a specific sequence if required.
    - Added option to set the shutdown type on a guest when the host is
    shutdown
    - Added VirtualBox preference to set the location of the autostart
    database
    - Snapshot Tree: Moved 'current state' underneath the most recent
    snapshot in
      the tree
    - Added state icons to the snapshot list, which indicate if a snapshot is
    an online or offline snapshot
    - Optimized list handling in several places which should improve
    performance
      and remember selections on list refreshes where practical.
    - Added additional information when a storage medium is selected in the
    VMM
    - Added additional guest keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl-Alt-(F4, F5, F6, F8,
    F9, F10, F11)
    - Added ability to add, remove and edit NAT Networks via the VirtualBox
      preferences menu item. Port forwarding rules must be configured
      elsewhere for the moment.
    - Added option to set the network attachment type in the guest settings
    to 'NAT Network'. These are named NAT networks which are subtly different
      to just 'NAT'.
    - Added option to set the snapshot folder location for a guest
    - Added OS icons for various editions of MacOS X.
    - Added support for guest groups. Groups are shown in a tree-fashion
    which is somewhat visually different to VirtualBox. Setting guest groups
    is fairly rudimentary at the moment requiring you to enter the group in
    the form of '/group/subgroup'.
    - Added 'Expand All Groups' and 'Collapse All Groups' buttons. The last
    used button is remembered for subsequent refreshes of the guest list
    - Fixed some Windows guest icons.
    - Fixed a bug when creating Host-Only networks. An associated virtual
    DHCP server wasn't getting created which would cause invalid object
    references and ultimately made the Host-Only network feature useless.
    - Fixed a bug when entering folders in the remote file chooser that
    denied permission but the location was still updated. Now also warns
    that you don't have permission to enter that folder
    - Fixed a bug where a medium would be masked out in lists if another
    medium with the same name existed.
    - Fixed a bug where the Video Memory could get erroneously pegged to 1MB
    on the first opening on the settings dialog.
    - Inaccessible guests are now filtered from the list of guests and a
    warning issued in the message log. RemoteBox has never handled
    inaccessible guests well and for the most part the cause is generally the
    user manipulating guests without VirtualBox's knowledge. 
    - Various GUI tweaks

remotebox (1.7-1~getdeb1) saucy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - Added Video Capture support for the guest's display
    - FreeRDP (aka xfreerdp) is now the default and recommended RDP client.
    If you
      used rdesktop previously, your preferences will follow however you can
      update your preferences if you desire. Go to File->RemoteBox
      Preferences and under RDP client, change it to:
      xfreerdp -g %Xx%Y --plugin cliprdr --plugin rdpsnd -T "%n - RemoteBox"
      %h:%p
      NOTE: You may need to install the freerdp package for your operating
      system.
    - Added additional substitutions for use with the RDP Client preference.
    These are:
        %X - The Auto-Hint Resolution width
        %Y - The Auto-Hint Resolution height
        %D - The Auto-Hint Resolution depth
      These can be used for specifying desired resolutions with your RDP
      client.
    - Fixed a bug where cached information (which was potentially invalid)
    was not flushed completely across a new connection to a server
    - Fixed a guest cloning bug where the machine reference was being used
    before the guest was fully cloned, causing GUI deadlock until the clone
    had completed
    - Fixed adding a host only network interfaces where the new interface
    would not immediately show up. Primarily only affected windows hosts
    - Fixed a bug preventing logging in when using Perl 5.18
      (Fedora 20, OpenSUSE 13.1, NetBSD 6, FreeBSD etc)
    - Improved remote file path handling across disparate operating systems
    (again)
    - Improved remote file dialogs
    - Improved progress dialogs. They show time remaining where available and
    can be cancelled where VirtualBox allows.
    - Spin boxes now accept case insensitive unit qualifiers where
    applicable:
      (eg MB, GB, TB) for specifying memory and disk sizes
      (eg ms, secs, mins) for specifying time
    - Worked around a bug where VirtualBox strips the leading path of a
    location on a reload when a double / is found in the path. This could
    cause disks to be inaccessible (due to incorrect path) when
    VirtualBox is reloaded.
    - Various GUI tweaks

remotebox (1.6-1~getdeb1) saucy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - This version brings VirtualBox 4.3.x support and drops support for the
      VirtualBox 4.2.x branch
    - Rebased from GTK 2.22 to GTK 2.24 as a minimum requirement
    - Default rdesktop preference now enables guest sound support and
    clipboard
      sharing.
      rdesktop -r sound:local -r clipboard:PRIMARYCLIPBOARD -T "%n -
      RemoteBox" %h:%p
    - Added preference to automatically add the VBoxAdditions.iso to the
    Virtual
      Media Manager when connecting to a server.
    - Added USB Multi-Touch pointing device support
    - Added RemoteBox preference to set the default RDP Port range for new
    guests
    - Added Discard Saved State toolbutton and menu option
    - Added Clear Connection History menu item to the File menu
    - Added configuration evaulation option to the tools menu of the edit
    settings
      dialog. It evaluates the current guest settings and makes
      recommendations.
    - Added support for attaching SCSI and SAS CD/DVDs to guests
    - Added auto-hint resolution option to preferences
    - Refreshed guest operating system icons
    - Now sets the default RDP port range for new guests created with
    RemoteBox to
      3389-4389, instead of a random port. This makes firewall configuration
      easier
      and VirtualBox will automatically use the next free port to avoid
      conflicts
    - Fixed exception when reading an empty or non-existant guest log
    - Fixed double-line spacing when showing huest logs from Windows servers
    - Fixed a bug when releasing DVD or Floppy media from the VMM. It no
    longer
      removes the virtual floppy or dvd drive, but just ejects the floppy or
      dvd
      image.
    - Fixed several bugs when editing the host-only networks - some outdated
    API
      calls were being used which generated an exception
    - Fixed some path handling bugs affecting Windows
    - Moved hardware virtualization exlusive option from guest settings to
    the
      VirtualBox preferences as it's now a global option in VirtualBox
    - Dropped WinMM audio. Guests using this will automatically be mapped to
    the
      Null audio driver and can't be manually changed to DirectSound if
      required
    - Various GUI tweaks and code optimisations
