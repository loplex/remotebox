Description: Open Source VirtualBox Client with Remote Management
 RemoteBox allows you to administer an installation of
 VirtualBox residing on another machine such as a server,
 as if it was installed locally. You can also interact with
 the displays of the guests. This allows you to treat
 VirtualBox much more like an installation of Xen,
 KVM or VMware ESX. A summary of some of the features of
 RemoteBox are listed below:
 .
  * Open source VirtualBox client with a graphical (GTK+)
    interface
  * Remote management of VirtualBox and its guests
  * No web server such as Apache or IIS is required to run
    RemoteBox
  * No compilation is required - written entirely in Perl
  * View and interact with the guest's display via RDP,
    including sound.
  * Create and edit guests
  * Configure processor, display, input devices,
    audio, I/O ports, and shared folders
  * Set the guest BIOS configuration including the
    BIOS image
  * Set advanced options such as HPET, Page Fusion,
    Large Pages, CPU Hotplugging, CPU Throttling etc
  * Attach USB devices and set USB device filters
  * Stop, start, pause and save guest states
  * Provision and attach storage including hard disks,
    CDs/DVDs and floppy disks
  * Configure networking including host only networks
    with DHCP servers
  * Supports guest snapshots
