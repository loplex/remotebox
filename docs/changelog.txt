- Added additional screen modes for video capture and video hinting
- Added option to select between Video and Audio, Video Only or Audio Only when
  screen capturing
- Added support for VirtualBox VGA card with VMware SVGA II extensions
- Added support for having no graphics card in the guest. Note however, you
  cannot connect to the guest with RDP/VNC without a virtual graphics card.
- Added support for setting the emulated serial UART type
- The Audio Input and Audio Output options can now also be set while the guest
  is running
- Added support to the VMM (Virtual Media Manager) for compaction of hard disk
  images to reduce their physical size

  settings are now explicitly saved. This includes adding, editing and deleting
- Optimised a lot of the settings retrieval code which should improve latency
  especially for those on slower systems and networks.
- Fixed the Edit Shared Folder dialog not correctly showing a share's Permanent
  Status, when editing the shared folder.
- Various code cleanups

2.5 (29 Apr 2018)
-----------------

- RemoteBox now only pops up a VirtualBox Extensions warning dialog on login,
  for server operating systems that have them available but the extension pack
  is not installed. Currently this is Linux, Solaris, Windows and MacOS X.
  Others such as FreeBSD will just get a warning in the message log as there
  are no VirtualBox extensions.
- Added support for setting the Audio driver of a guest when using a FreeBSD
  server
- Improved the code which automatically adds the guest addition ISO to the VMM
  on login which should prevent an error if the server does not provide a guest
  additions ISO
- Added support for VNC. If your server has the VNC extension pack installed,
  you can use VNC to connect to the guest displays instead of RDP. You must
  install a VNC client on your RemoteBox machine and configure it as
  appropriate in your preferences. TigerVNC is the default client
- The guest display icon now shows whether the server expects a VNC or RDP
  connection when opening the display of guests.
- Added option to change the floppy drive type to 360k, 720k, 1.44MB, 2.88MB
  15.6MB and 63.5MB.
- Added a button to assist with the automatic generation of serial port paths
- Fixed a bug causing the port path setting to be reset with the defaults
- Fixed audio support for Solaris servers. The SolAudio driver is non
  functional in VirtualBox and has been replaced with OSS.

2.4 (4 Nov 2017)
----------------

- RemoteBox now requires VirtualBox 5.2.x
- Updated guest icons
- Added option to enable/disable audio output from a guest

- Added ability to select a connection profile to use for automatically logging
  in when starting up RemoteBox.
- Added option 'Release Keys' to clear any held keys in the case where a host
  and guest's keyboard status may become out of sync.
- New guests now automatically have their audio output enabled
- Fixed: You now can't set video RAM to zero, even though VirtualBox reports
  this as a valid minimum, the guest won't start.


2.3 (5 May 2017)
----------------

- Implemented a connection profile manager and changed the connection dialog.
  Passwords can optionally be saved, however if you're highly concerned about
  security, the password can still be manually entered at connection time.

  RemoteBox session.
- Added preference option to sort the guest list alphabetically or leave it in
  natural order.
- Default RDP option now uses the FreeRDP new syntax unless previously
  configured
- Added OS icon for Windows 2016
- Fixed regression when setting setting the auto start delay time for a guest,
  it would get reset to 0
- When renaming the current snapshot, the new name would not be shown in the
  guest list until refreshed. This has now been fixed.
- Various minor GUI tweaks

  not
- Updated the number of possible SAS ports from 8 to 255 for an attached medium
- Updated FreeBSD guest OS Icons
- Fixed a bug when assigning a different SAS port to a medium. RemoteBox was
  not creating the SAS port first causing a port out of range error.
- Fixed a bug when selecting storage attached to the USB controller. RemoteBox
  incorrectly showed the IDE controller attributes.
- Set default guest OS types for new guests to Windows 10 64bit, Fedora 64bit,
  FreeBSD 64bit and DOS for their respective OS families

  currently FreeRDP (New Syntax), FreeRDP (Old Syntax), Rdesktop, Windows
  Remote Desktop Client
- Added support for selecting the paravirtualization interface for a guest
- Added keyboard toolbutton for quick access to common keyboard sequences. The
  full keyboard menu is still available

1.8.1 (8 Jun 2014)
------------------

- Minor update to fix a SOAP versioning bug experienced by some users
- Bundle an .appdata.xml file for packagers which wish to use it


1.8 (16 May 2014)
-----------------

- Added option to automatically start chosen guests when the host system boots.
  This requires some server side configuration before it can be used. Consult
  the RemoteBox manual for more information.
- Added option to set the start delay on an autostarting guest so that guests
  can be started up in a specific sequence if required.
- Added option to set the shutdown type on a guest when the host is shutdown
- Added VirtualBox preference to set the location of the autostart database
- Snapshot Tree: Moved 'current state' underneath the most recent snapshot in
  the tree
- Added state icons to the snapshot list, which indicate if a snapshot is an
  online or offline snapshot
- Optimized list handling in several places which should improve performance
  and remember selections on list refreshes where practical.
- Added additional information when a storage medium is selected in the VMM
- Added additional guest keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl-Alt-(F4, F5, F6, F8, F9,
  F10, F11)
- Added ability to add, remove and edit NAT Networks via the VirtualBox
  preferences menu item. Port forwarding rules must be configured elsewhere
  for the moment.
- Added option to set the network attachment type in the guest settings to
  'NAT Network'. These are named NAT networks which are subtly different to
  just 'NAT'.
- Added option to set the snapshot folder location for a guest
- Added OS icons for various editions of MacOS X.
- Added support for guest groups. Groups are shown in a tree-fashion which is
  somewhat visually different to VirtualBox. Setting guest groups is fairly
  rudimentary at the moment requiring you to enter the group in the form of
  '/group/subgroup'.
- Added 'Expand All Groups' and 'Collapse All Groups' buttons. The last used
  button is remembered for subsequent refreshes of the guest list
- Fixed some Windows guest icons.
- Fixed a bug when creating Host-Only networks. An associated virtual DHCP
  server wasn't getting created which would cause invalid object references and
  ultimately made the Host-Only network feature useless.
- Fixed a bug when entering folders in the remote file chooser that denied
  permission but the location was still updated. Now also warns that you
  don't have permission to enter that folder
- Fixed a bug where a medium would be masked out in lists if another medium
  with the same name existed.
- Fixed a bug where the Video Memory could get erroneously pegged to 1MB on
  the first opening on the settings dialog.
- Inaccessible guests are now filtered from the list of guests and a warning
  issued in the message log. RemoteBox has never handled inaccessible guests
  well and for the most part the cause is generally the user manipulating
  guests without VirtualBox's knowledge.
- Various GUI tweaks


1.7 (30 Jan 2014)
-----------------

- Added Video Capture support for the guest's display
- FreeRDP (aka xfreerdp) is now the default and recommended RDP client. If you
  used rdesktop previously, your preferences will follow however you can update
  your preferences if you desire. Go to File->RemoteBox Preferences and under
  RDP client, change it to:
  xfreerdp -g %Xx%Y --plugin cliprdr --plugin rdpsnd -T "%n - RemoteBox" %h:%p
  NOTE: You may need to install the freerdp package for your operating system.
- Added additional substitutions for use with the RDP Client preference. These
  are:
    %X - The Auto-Hint Resolution width
    %Y - The Auto-Hint Resolution height
    %D - The Auto-Hint Resolution depth
  These can be used for specifying desired resolutions with your RDP client.
- Fixed a bug where cached information (which was potentially invalid) was
  not flushed completely across a new connection to a server
- Fixed a guest cloning bug where the machine reference was being used before
  the guest was fully cloned, causing GUI deadlock until the clone had
  completed
- Fixed adding a host only network interfaces where the new interface would not
  immediately show up. Primarily only affected windows hosts
- ### Fixed a bug preventing logging in when using Perl 5.18 ###
  (Actually fixed in RemoteBox v1.8)
- Improved remote file path handling across disparate operating systems (again)
- Improved remote file dialogs
- Improved progress dialogs. They show time remaining where available and can
  be cancelled where VirtualBox allows.
- Spin boxes now accept case insensitive unit qualifiers where applicable:
  (eg MB, GB, TB) for specifying memory and disk sizes
  (eg ms, secs, mins) for specifying time
- Worked around a bug where VirtualBox strips the leading path of a location
  on a reload when a double / is found in the path. This could cause disks to
  be inaccessible (due to incorrect path) when VirtualBox is reloaded.
- Various GUI tweaks


1.6 (20 Oct 2013)
-----------------

- This version brings VirtualBox 4.3.x support and drops support for the
  VirtualBox 4.2.x branch
- Rebased from GTK 2.22 to GTK 2.24 as a minimum requirement
- Default rdesktop preference now enables guest sound support and clipboard
  sharing.
  rdesktop -r sound:local -r clipboard:PRIMARYCLIPBOARD -T "%n - RemoteBox" %h:%p
- Added preference to automatically add the VBoxAdditions.iso to the Virtual
  Media Manager when connecting to a server.
- Added USB Multi-Touch pointing device support
- Added RemoteBox preference to set the default RDP Port range for new guests
- Added Discard Saved State toolbutton and menu option
- Added Clear Connection History menu item to the File menu
- Added configuration evaulation option to the tools menu of the edit settings
  dialog. It evaluates the current guest settings and makes recommendations.
- Added support for attaching SCSI and SAS CD/DVDs to guests
- Added auto-hint resolution option to preferences
- Refreshed guest operating system icons
- Now sets the default RDP port range for new guests created with RemoteBox to
  3389-4389, instead of a random port. This makes firewall configuration easier
  and VirtualBox will automatically use the next free port to avoid conflicts
- Fixed exception when reading an empty or non-existant guest log
- Fixed double-line spacing when showing guest logs from Windows servers
- Fixed a bug when releasing DVD or Floppy media from the VMM. It no longer
  removes the virtual floppy or dvd drive, but just ejects the floppy or dvd
  image.
- Fixed several bugs when editing the host-only networks - some outdated API
  calls were being used which generated an exception
- Fixed some path handling bugs affecting Windows
- Moved hardware virtualization exclusive option from guest settings to the
  VirtualBox preferences as it's now a global option in VirtualBox
- Dropped WinMM audio. Guests using this will automatically be mapped to the
  Null audio driver but can be manually changed to DirectSound if required
- Various GUI tweaks and code optimisations


1.5 (26 Nov 2012)
-----------------

- Most of the guest's settings can now be changed while the guest is running,
  which should reduce the inconvenience of shutting the guest as previously
  required.
- Added ability to save screenshots of guests as PNG images.
- Added icon for Solaris 11 (64bit) guest OS
- Added icon for Windows 2012 (64bit) guest OS
- Added status icons for each guest in the list
- Added icons to the storage page when editing guest settings
- Now uses additional 'recommendedChipset', 'recommendedAudioController',
  'recommendedFloppy' and 'recommendedUSB' defaults when creating a new guest
- Fixed the System->Advanced->Time Offset widget when editing guest settings.
  The time offset could not be adjusted.
- Fixed the Display->Remote Display->Video Stream Quality widget when editing
  guest settings. The stream quality could not be adjusted.
- Fixed the memory setting, it no longer artificially limits a guest to 16GB
  of RAM
- Various minor GUI tweaks
- Added SSL certificate verification option


1.4 (15 Sep 2012)
-----------------

- This version brings VirtualBox 4.2.x support and drops support for the
  VirtualBox 4.1.x branch.
- Added the ability to hot-plug and hot-unplug CPUs from the guest whilst it
  is running. This requires setting the CPU hotplug option in the guest
  settings. You are advised to read the RemoteBox manual regarding this
  feature because support varies depending on the OS used in the guest.
- Added support for creating QED QEMU hard disk images
- Added support for creating QCOW QEMU hard disk images
- Added the ability to attach physical CD/DVD drives to a guest
- Added the ability to attach physical floppy drives to a guest
- Improved guest session handlers and guest locking
- Deleting a guest now deletes the associated screenshot icon (if any)
- Increased the number of configurable network cards for a guest to 8 cards.
  The selected card is now chosen by a combobox rather than a tab.
- Added additional keyboard entries which send keyboard sequences of the form
  'Alt-SysRq+x', for example Alt-SysRq+F1. These were often used under very old
  UNIX flavours such as Dell UNIX, AT&T UNIX, ISC UNIX etc to switch between
  virtual terminals.
- Added button to generate a new MAC address for a virtual network card when
  editing a guest's settings
- Fixed a minor bug where file permissions were being shown as decimal numbers
  in the remote file chooser, rather than the conventional octal.


1.3 (3 June 2012)
-----------------

- Added ability to attach and detach USB devices to the guest whilst it is
  running. Accessible from the "Machine->USB Devices" menu
- Added option to set the guest's screenshot as it's icon. Instead of the
  default operating system icon, you can now show a thumbnail screenshot
  instead. Accessible from Machine->Screenshot
- Added option to reset the guest's icon back to the default
- Implemented a heartbeat to keep connections alive, which should stop the web
  service from severing the connection if it's timeout has not been disabled.
  In any case the web service should not be configured with a timeout < 60
  seconds. The default web service timeout is 300 seconds.
- Vastly improved connection handling in cases where RemoteBox loses its
  connection to the server or the connection is terminated
- Improved handling of invalid references, allow you to continue or abort the
  current session.
- Added option to view the guest's logs as retrieved from VirtualBox. Up to
  four logs can be viewed.
- Added the ability to select multiple files in the remote file choosers, where
  appropriate. For example when adding hard disks, CDs/DVDs or floppies to the
  VMM. This allows you to add multiple media easily in one operation.
- Spinboxes now scale units where appropriate
- Use tripple parameter form of open() to improve opening files with unusual
  characters
- Added some spinners to the progress dialogs
- Significant optimisations to the remote file chooser code
- Renamed File->Preferences to File->RemoteBox Preferences to make it more
  clear that these preferences are for RemoteBox as opposed to VirtualBox
- Changed hotkey for "File->VirtualBox Preferences" to 'b' to avoid a clash
  with "File->Virtual Media Manager"
- Reduced the number of busy window calls which should help the GUI feel more
  responsive


1.2 (30 Dec 2011)
-----------------

- Rebased from GTK 2.16 to GTK 2.22 as the minimum version. If your OS / Distro
  is not new enough, you may wish to remain at v1.1.
- Added support for creating Full, State and Linked clones of guests
- When creating a parallels hard disk the image is now created with the .hdd
  extension rather than .parallels
- The state of the option on the connect dialog to save URLs and Usernames is
  now remembered between RemoteBox sessions
- Added option to attach an empty CD/DVD drive when editing a guest's settings
- Added option to attach an empty Floppy drive when editing a guest's settings
- Added option to manually set the port count for SATA controllers
- Added option to mark a hard disk image as a Solid State disk
- Added an option to mark a CD/DVD image as a Live CD/DVD.
- Added ability to manually set the port on a controller that a medium is
  attached to
- Added a refresh button to the Virtual Media Manager to refresh the list of
  current media
- Added support for changing a disk images type to Normal, Writethrough,
  Immutable and Multi-Attach
- Added a facility in the VMM to provide for the duplication and copying of
  hard disks. This also allows you to convert a disk from one format to another
- Timestamps are now prefixed to entries in the message log
- Hopefully finally fixed the bug where the change CD and Floppy menus were
  available when they should not be, even though this was supposed to be fixed
  in v1.1
- More fixes to the DVD & Floppy items in the Machine menu. On occassions it
  would still permit you to change disks on an unselected guest.
- Minor bug fix when reporting errors from VirtualBox or SOAP which contained
  <> characters. This would end up being treated as GTK markup
- Fixed the maximum BIOS time waiting to 65535. Higher values are invalid and
  the guest will not start until its changed.
- The usual plethora of GUI tweaks
- Significant code optimisation with rebasing to GTK 2.22


1.1 (25 Oct 2011)
-----------------

- Cosmetic changes to the New Virtual Machine and Create New HD dialogs
- Cosmetic changes to the network part of the Edit Settings dialog
- Added support for creating a new guest without a hard disk
- Added support for creating VMDK disk images (Dynamic, Fixed and
  2GB Split types)
- Added support for creating VHD disk images (Dynamic and Fixed types)
- Added support for creating Parallels disk images (Dynamic)
- Added additional run-time information such as the version of guest additions
  installed when showing 'more details' for a guest
- Added supported for setting the promiscuous mode policy on guest network
  adapters
- Added support for setting a generic network driver and generic properties
- Improved the handling of ports on storage controllers, for example SATA
  controllers are not created with all ports enabled by default
- Improved the internal network name widget. A drop down list of internal
  networks is now presented rather than having to manually type it
- Now displays a warning if the server does not have the Oracle VM VirtualBox
  Extension Pack installed or if the extension pack is outdated.
- Fixed a minor bug when showing 'more details' for a guest. The network details
  were not shown.
- Fixed minor bug where the Remove and Release buttons on the VMM dialog were
  sometimes enabled when they shouldn't have been.
- Fixed a bug where the change CD and Floppy menus were available, even when
  a guest was powered off
- Attaching storage to a guest now explicitly saves the guest settings, even if
  you subsequently press cancel in order to work around what seems to be a
  VirtualBox bug. Previously, attaching a disk but cancelling the settings lead
  to a dichotomy where the disk image believed it was attached to the guest but
  the guest disagreed. This would cause side-effects such as being unable to
  release the medium or VirtualBox complaining that a disk referenced a guest
  which does not exist.


1.0 (10 Aug 2011)
-----------------

- This version concentrated on bringing compatibility with VirtualBox 4.1.X.
  New VirtualBox 4.1 features will be added in subsequent releases.
- Fixed a particularly horrible bug which was probably introduced in 0.8 or 0.9
  caused by the unintentional emmission of GTK signals when opening the edit
  window for the first time on a new connection. Any guest settings which used
  a slider (eg memory) got reset to the base value which would be saved if the
  user chose save.
- Fixed a bug where attempting to delete a snapshot with more than one child
  would cause an invalid object reference.
- Further improvements to the remote file chooser dialog. File paths are now
  better "sanitised".


0.9 (22 Jul 2011)
-----------------

- Added an option to Add an existing guest by selecting it's .vbox file.
- Added a remote file chooser for setting the default machine folder. The user
  no longer has to manually type the path.
- Added a remote file chooser for setting a shared folder. The user no longer
  has to manually type the path.
- RemoteBox now tries to restore the location and size of the main window on
  restart.
- When removing a guest, you are now prompted to choose whether you want to
  delete the associated files or only remove (ie just unregister) the guest
  from VirtualBox. Caution: Do not select "Delete All Files" if your server
  is running a 64bit Windows Edition. A bug in VirtualBox can cause it to crash
- Fixed an issue (only really affected Mac OS X) where the preferences would
  not be saved if the XDG preference directory did not exist.
- Fixed a race condition which meant the context menu would not always present
  the Mount DVD/CD and Mount Floppy options correctly.
- Fixed an issue whereby selecting a storage unit allowed you to change the
  controller settings. The controller settings should only be available when
  a controller is selected.
- Worked-around an issue on Ubuntu/Mint where the treeviews appear to emit a
  phantom cursor-changed signal sometimes.
- Editing of the guest's description has been moved to the settings dialog, in
  keeping with VirtualBox's GUI.
- When selecting a guest, a small summary of it's details are automatically
  displayed. Fuller details can be viewed by clicking on "Show More Details"
  The full details are not automatically displayed for performance reasons.
- Double clicking a guest or pressing the "Show More Details" button displays
  an in depth list of the guest's configuration which shows more information
  than previous versions of RemoteBox
- Tabs throughout the GUI are now reorderable and have popup menus
- Improved the remote file chooser dialog.
- Numerous minor GUI tweaks and improvements


0.8 (03 Apr 2011)
-----------------

- Added support for configuring a parallel port in the guests.
  Note: Parallel port is only supported on VirtualBox hosts running Linux.
- Added "Advanced" and "Boot Logo" tabs to the "System" page of the
  "Edit Settings" window.
- The fade settings of the guest BIOS screen can now be configured.
- The waiting time on the guest BIOS screen can also be configured. Useful for
  pressing BIOS hot keys etc.
- The BIOS logo is now customizable. The image file must be a 640x480
  uncompressed BMP file with a 256 colour (8bit) palette.
- Time offsets can now be applied to guests' clocks. The guest will run its
  clock ahead of the host's clock with the specified offset. This is not
  intended to replace correctly configured timezones in guests.
- Added support for sending video hints to the guest, to change its screen
  resolution. Several pre-defined screen resolutions exist as well as an
  option to set a custom screen resolution. Access the resolutions from the
  "Machine" menu
- Added support for sending Ctrl-c and Ctrl-d keyboard sequences to the guest.
  Access the keyboard sequences from the "Machine" menu
- Added option to configure CPU Hot Plugging for a guest
- Added option to configure Page Fusion for a guest. Page Fusion can reduce
  host memory consumption when running many similar guests.
- Added option to enable the use of Large Pages (if your OS supports them),
  this can provide a small performance increase
- Added ability to set the amount of host CPU time each guest is allowed to
  consume
- Added support for setting the virtual keyboard type. Supported types are:
  None, PS2, USB, and Combo.
- Added an option to provide a guest with an HPET (High Precision Event Timer)
- Added an option to allow VirtualBox to share the hardware virtualization
  extensions (VT-x/AMD-V) with other Hypervisors.
- Added a caching mechanism to the editing of guest settings which should speed
  up the opening of the "Edit Settings" window.
- Added a remotebox preference to automatically open the guest's display when
  the guest is started. Default is enabled, but can be disabled in preferences
- Added a remotebox preference to configure the default action of the "Stop"
  button. Previously it defaulted to "Instant Power Off" but can now be
  configured to do an "ACPI Shutdown" or "Save State". Note, the button's popup
  menu is still available to choose an alternative from the default
- The message log now remembers whether it was expanded or not between program
  runs.
- The "Serial" page of the "Edit Settings" window has now been renamed to
  "I/O Ports"
- Various minor tweaks to the GUI
- Fixed preference file handling in the unlikely case where a parameter
  contains an '=' character.


0.7 (20 Feb 2011)
-----------------

- Implemented a file selector dialog for navigating the file system on the
  remote server. This means hard disk images, CD/DVD isos and floppy disk
  images can be added into VirtualBox easily. You no longer need to manually
  type the complete path and remember the location.
- Fixed the message log scrolling. It now automatically scrolls completely to
  the bottom.
- The message log can now be made hidden or visible using an expander.
- CDs, DVDs and Floppies can now be added directly by selecting the DVD or
  Floppy Drive when editing the storage for guest. You no longer need to select
  the controller itself.
- The VMM now shows if media is not accessible in the list views, with the
  reason shown as a tooltip
- Fixed regression which was disallowing the removal ('deletion') of
  inaccessible hard disks.
- Fixed a regression where DVDs/CDs & Floppies could not be unmounted from the
  RMB menu.
- The 'Use existing hard disk' option when creating a new guest now lists the
  existing hard disks in alphabetical order.
- Major optimisation of show_rmb_menu(), should help the right mouse button
  menu feel more responsive, particularly on slow connections. Also the right
  mouse button popup menu is now identical to the main Machine menu.
- Added location field to bottom of VMM dialog
- Hopefully fixed an issue where UTF-8 characters could cause the SOAP module
  to raise an exception.
- Added Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, Ctrl-Alt-F1, Ctrl-Alt-F2, Ctrl-Alt-F3, Ctrl-Alt-F7
  and Ctrl-Alt-F12 guest keyboard inserts.


0.6 (25 Jan 2011)
-----------------

RemoteBox now requires at least version 4.0.X of VirtualBox

- Removed default hard disk folder preference. No longer required with
  VirtualBox 4
- As VirtualBox 4 now consolidates storage and guest settings together, the
  creation of new hard disk images has been moved to the storage tab under the
  guest settings and is no longer part of the Virtual Media Manager.
- Further improved the defaults when creating a new guest, including HPET,
  Pointer Type, Network Adapter Type and RTC
- Added support for Intel HDA audio controller
- Added support for auto-mounting VirtualBox shared folders
- Added support for setting the motherboard chipset (PIIX3 or ICH9)
- Added icon for JRockitVE
- Attaching CD/DVD drives to SATA controllers is now permitted
- Shared folders list now warns if a shared folder is not accessible


0.5 (21 Nov 2010)
-----------------

- Added support for creating, editing, deleting and enabling USB device filters
  (Machine->Settings->USB)
- Added support for pausing and resuming guest execution
  (Machine->Pause), (Machine->Resume)

  - (File->VirtualBox Preferences->General)
- Added option to configure default machine folder.
  - (File->VirtualBox Preferences->General)

- The snapshot details dialog now lets you edit the name and description of an
  existing snapshot
- Replaced the status bar with a messages list which holds more history
- Moved the user config file to the freedesktop location as specified by
  get_user_config_dir(). On most distros this usually expands to
  $HOME/.config/remotebox.conf. You will need to move your existing config file
  if you wish to preserve it.
- RemoteBox no longer exclusively uses the first port specified in the guest
  config when attempting an RDP connection. This means RemoteBox will still
  connect to the remote display when the server chooses another port if the
  primary port is already in use.
- Lots of code restructuring and cleanup
- Deleting a medium which is locked by another process should no longer produce
  a bunch of unmanaged object reference messages.
